This is built with customizability and mobile in mind hence the existence of a redundant SaaS file. In its current form I would recommend you just use the human benchmark website instead. But if you're looking for a script to customise it's fairly easy to use non-decimal number systems for example. the is_done function outputs to json array that can be used for storing data backwards compatibley ie you update your app and decide you want to store everything on a mongo database call the previous data won't be lost but you need to store string that client side depending on your method of deployment
